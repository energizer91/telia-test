## Other notes
You haven't provided responsive Ð¸ style for mobile devices, so I've just rendered them in on one column.
Yes, I know, we can move description thumbnail one level up and decrease number of html elements, but I think it's a bit over engineering for no reasons.
Also I decided to use just one CSS file since we don't have many styles, and I don't want to use some third party style libraries.
